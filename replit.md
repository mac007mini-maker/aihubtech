## Replit Setup Instructions

### Fresh Import Setup (First Time)

When importing this project to Replit for the first time:

1. **Install System Dependencies:**
   - The project will automatically install `unzip` via Replit packages
   
2. **Install Flutter SDK:**
   ```bash
   bash setup_flutter.sh
   ```
   This script automatically:
   - Clones Flutter stable from GitHub
   - Initializes the Flutter toolchain
   - Sets up the correct PATH

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   Python dependencies are managed via `uv` and will auto-install:
   - gradio_client
   - Pillow
   - replicate
   - requests

4. **Configure Secrets:**
   Add these API keys via Replit Secrets tool:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
   - `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`: Your Huggingface API token
   - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`: Your Replicate API token

5. **Start the Application:**
   The workflow is configured to run `bash start_server.sh` which:
   - Checks for Flutter SDK (runs setup if needed)
   - Builds Flutter web app (first run takes 5-10 minutes)
   - Starts Python backend on port 5000
   - Serves the complete application

### Deployment Configuration

- **Deployment Type:** VM (always-on server)
- **Port:** 5000 (frontend + backend combined)
- **Run Command:** `bash start_server.sh`
- **Output:** Webview (displays the Flutter web app)

## Recent Changes

### October 15, 2025 - Face Swap Cascading Fallback Strategy
- **Intelligent Multi-Provider Fallback System**:
  - Implements robust failover across 5 different face swap services
  - Automatic timeout handling prevents service delays
  - Guarantees best possible success rate for face swap operations
- **Replicate Models (Primary - 3 models with cascading fallback)**:
  1. `easel/advanced-face-swap` (Best quality, 60s timeout) - Production-ready, full-body swap
  2. `cdingram/face-swap` (Backup 1, 45s timeout) - 1.1M+ runs, reliable
  3. `omniedgeio/face-swap` (Backup 2, 45s timeout) - Community favorite
- **Huggingface Spaces (Free fallback - 2 spaces)**:
  1. `prithivMLmods/Face-Swap-Roop` (Most popular, 60s timeout)
  2. `BLACKHOOL/Roop-face-swap` (Backup, 60s timeout)
- **Timeout Strategy**:
  - Each service has individual timeout to prevent hanging
  - Automatic cascade to next service on timeout/failure
  - Total max wait: ~5 minutes across all services
- **User Experience**:
  - Transparent error messages identify which service was used
  - Fallback happens automatically without user intervention
  - Success rate significantly improved vs single-provider approach
- **Updated in:** `services/image_ai_service.py`

### October 14, 2025 - Firebase Remote Config Ad Network Selection Feature
- **New Remote Config Parameters for Ad Network Control**:
  - `banner_ad_network`: Choose network for banner ads ("admob", "applovin", or "auto")
  - `rewarded_ad_network`: Choose network for rewarded ads ("admob", "applovin", or "auto")
  - `app_open_ad_network`: Choose network for app open ads ("admob", "applovin", or "auto")
  - Default: "auto" (AdMob primary → AppLovin fallback)
- **Network Selection Modes**:
  - **"admob"**: Use AdMob only (no fallback) - Best for testing AdMob performance
  - **"applovin"**: Use AppLovin only (no fallback) - Best for testing AppLovin performance
  - **"auto"**: Try AdMob first, fallback to AppLovin if failed - Best for maximum fill rate
- **Use Cases**:
  - A/B testing: Compare revenue between AdMob vs AppLovin
  - Performance optimization: Choose best-performing network per ad type
  - Troubleshooting: Isolate network-specific issues
- **Example Configuration**:
  - Banner ads → AdMob (higher CPM for banners)
  - Rewarded ads → AppLovin (better fill rate for rewarded)
  - App Open ads → AdMob (faster load times)
- **Updated in:** `lib/services/remote_config_service.dart`, `lib/swapface/swapface_widget.dart`, `lib/components/bottom_navigation_with_ad.dart`, `lib/main.dart`, `lib/services/applovin_stub.dart`

- **AppLovin Test Mode Implementation**:
  - Added `await AppLovinMAX.setTestDeviceAdvertisingIds()` with 5 registered test devices
  - Test devices: note8, mumu, samsung, ldplayer, vuvu (IDFAs from AppLovin Console)
  - Ensures test mode is active before ad loads begin
  - **Note**: Test device IDs should be removed before production release

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application uses FlutterFlow-generated components for a consistent and responsive design, supporting both light and dark themes. The UI features modern carousels with PageView sliders, smooth transitions, dot indicators, and integrated ad banners positioned above navigation bars for Google Ads policy compliance. A feedback system allows users to submit feature requests via an integrated dialog.

### Technical Implementations
Built with Flutter 3.32.0 (Dart 3.8.0), the application integrates with a Python Flask backend acting as a proxy for AI services. This backend handles text/image generation and advanced image processing with an asynchronous architecture.

### Feature Specifications
- **AI Headshot Generation**: Studio-grade AI headshots.
- **Photo Enhancement**:
    - **HD Image Enhancement**: 3-tier fallback system using Huggingface Inference API (Primary), Replicate Real-ESRGAN (Fallback), and Huggingface Space (Last Resort).
    - **Old Photo Restoration**: Utilizes GFPGAN via Replicate.
- **Face Swapping**: AI-powered face replacement with gallery permission handling and rewarded ad integration (mobile).
- **AI Style Templates**: Diverse templates for aesthetic transformations (e.g., cartoonify, various avatar styles).
- **Monetization**:
    - **Advertising (Free Users)**:
        - **Web**: Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).
        - **Mobile (iOS/Android)**: Dual-network ad system (AdMob primary, AppLovin MAX fallback) for banner, app open, and rewarded ads.
        - **Firebase Remote Config**: Dynamic ad control for `ads_enabled`, `banner_ads_enabled`, `rewarded_ads_enabled`, `app_open_ads_enabled`, supporting granular control and A/B testing.
    - **In-App Purchases (Premium Users)**:
        - **RevenueCat SDK**: Complete IAP management with subscription tiers (Lifetime, Yearly, Weekly).
        - **Test Mode Support**: Mock purchases for local testing without Google Play/App Store setup.
        - **Premium Features**: Automatic ad bypass, unlimited creations, priority processing.
        - **Cross-Platform**: Android (Google Play), iOS (App Store) with unified API.
    - **Premium User Support**: Automatically bypasses all ads for premium subscribers.
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for 20 languages with interactive selection and persistence.
- **Mobile Download**: Images saved directly to Gallery/Photos app using `gal` package with automatic album creation (VisoAI). Provides instant visibility in device photo gallery with proper MediaScanner integration.
- **Settings Features**: Includes Share, Feedback (email integration), About, User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines.

### System Design Choices
The application uses Supabase for backend services (authentication, database, storage). AI functionalities are powered by Huggingface Spaces and Replicate APIs, accessed via a Python proxy server. Face swap templates are dynamically loaded from Supabase Storage, supporting automated discovery and management.
