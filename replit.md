### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a consistent and responsive design built with FlutterFlow-generated components, supporting both light and dark themes. It incorporates modern UI elements such as carousels with PageView sliders, smooth transitions, and dot indicators. Ad banners are strategically placed above navigation bars. A feedback system allows users to submit feature requests.

### Technical Implementations
Developed with Flutter 3.32.0 (Dart 3.8.0), Viso AI integrates with a Python Flask backend. This backend serves as a proxy for complex asynchronous image processing tasks and AI model interactions.

### Feature Specifications

- **Photo Enhancement**: Includes HD Image Enhancement (via Replicate Real-ESRGAN) and Old Photo Restoration (via Replicate GFPGAN).
- **Face Swapping**: Offers AI-powered face replacement with a multi-provider fallback system (PiAPI primary, Replicate fallback), robust gallery permission handling, and rewarded ad integration. Supports both image and video face swap functionalities.
- **AI Style Templates**: Features 14 diverse template categories for face swap and aesthetic transformations (e.g., Travel, Gym, Selfie, Tattoo, Wedding, Sport, Christmas, New Year, Birthday, School, Fashion Show, Profile, Suits). Each category includes carousel layouts and direct download capabilities. Templates are loaded dynamically from Supabase Storage.

- **Internationalization**: Supports 20 languages with interactive selection.
- **Mobile Download**: Images are saved to a dedicated "VisoAI" album in the device's gallery.
- **Settings**: Includes options for sharing, feedback, an "About" section, User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines.

### System Design Choices
Supabase provides core backend services, including authentication, database, and storage. AI functionalities are primarily powered by Huggingface Spaces and Replicate APIs, accessed through a Python Flask proxy server. Face swap templates and video templates are dynamically loaded from Supabase Storage.

**Production Deployment Strategy:**
- **Backend**: Deployed on Railway Hobby for the Flask + Gunicorn application.
- **Database/Auth/Storage**: Managed by Supabase.
- **Mobile**: Flutter APK with `--split-per-abi` optimization.
